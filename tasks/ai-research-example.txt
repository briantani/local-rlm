- Clear section headings
- Embedded data visualizations (saved as PNG)
- Comparison tables
- Citation section with links to sources
- Executive summary at the beginning
- Conclusions and future outlook at the end

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive coverage of the 2020-2025 period
- At least 5 high-quality visualizations
- Minimum 3 comparison tables with quantitative data
- Insightful analysis beyond mere fact reporting
- Clear writing suitable for technical audience
- Professional formatting throughout
