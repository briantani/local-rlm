# Uses GPT-5.2 (the best model for coding and agentic tasks)
# with GPT-5-mini for cost-effective recursive calls

profile_name: "High-Quality (GPT-5.2)"
description: |
  Premium quality profile using GPT-5.2 (OpenAI's flagship model for coding
  and agentic tasks) for root reasoning, with GPT-5-mini for recursive sub-calls.
  Optimized for complex research and analysis where accuracy is paramount.

# Root agent configuration (the main agent)
root:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-5.2  # The best model for coding and agentic tasks
  max_steps: 15
  max_depth: 4
  pricing:
    input_per_1m: 1.75    # $1.75 per 1M input tokens (Standard tier)
    output_per_1m: 14.00  # $14.00 per 1M output tokens

# Delegate agent configuration (recursive sub-agents)
delegate:
  provider: openai
  model: gpt-5-mini  # Fast, cost-efficient version
  max_steps: 8
  max_depth: 2  # Prevent infinite recursion chains
  pricing:
    input_per_1m: 0.25   # 7x cheaper than root
    output_per_1m: 2.00

# Per-module model overrides (optional fine-tuning)
modules:
  # Architect makes the CODE/ANSWER/DELEGATE decision - needs good reasoning
  architect:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5.2  # Use flagship model for critical decisions
    pricing:
      input_per_1m: 1.75
      output_per_1m: 14.00

  # Coder generates Python code - GPT-5.2 excels at coding
  coder:
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-5-mini  # Code generation with cost efficiency
    pricing:
      input_per_1m: 0.25

      output_per_1m: 2.00

# Global budget limit (sum of all model costs)
budget:
  max_usd: 5.0  # Higher budget for quality tasks
  # Per-model pricing is defined above; budget manager tracks each model separately

# DSPy configuration
